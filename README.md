# ImageClassificationCIFAR
This repository contains image classification models on the CIFAR-10 dataset. 

There are two types of models implemented for this project.
1. DNN without convolution layer.
2. DNN with convolution layer.

A basic model for each method is implemented. The main motive is to improve this basic models by improving the accuracy of the classification models.

After improving both the models, images are predicted from both models to compare how they perform.
